## AI Provider for Groq by Marcus Green

This plugin is for the AI Subsystem delivered with Moodle 4.5.
It  allows you to use the [Groq Cloud](https://console.groq.com) as an AI provider. Groq is a hardware company that provides very low cost high performance access to open Models such as the Meta LLama range. They promote their technology as using Language Processing Units (LPU's) rather than Graphical Processing Units (GPU's) and so do not offer image generation.

### Configuration
To use this provider, you need to get key and an organisation id which can be found at

And enter these in the settings page for this plugin
